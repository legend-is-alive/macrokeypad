# Macrokeypad / MINI-KeyBoard

Reverse engineered programmer for Chinese macro keyboards.

Recently I bought a Chinese macro keyboard from eBay:

It looks good, works well, but no software was provided in the box and it took me a day to find the software, on some shady google drive link. The program was written in .NET, so I reverse engineered it and uploaded the code to GitHub.

Note: I didn't write the software and to tell the truth it works, but it doesn't provide the best user experience. So, if you have extension ideas, feel free to fork this repo and modify the code and extend this readme for fellow programmers.

## Modells suported
